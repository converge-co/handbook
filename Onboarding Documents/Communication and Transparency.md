# Communication and Transparency

The best way for you to make a decision about what’s good for Converge is to have all of the information about what’s going on at Converge. The same is true for everyone else you work with, so it’s important that we’re all up to date about what’s happening, even with the areas of Converge that we’re not actively involved with.

Transparency may seem like a passive process, like "don’t hide anything," but it’s actually a big challenge to keep everyone up to date and on the same page, especially on projects they’re not working on on a daily basis, even for a company the size of Converge. These are some of the policies we use to make information more accessible, but our work is ongoing.

## Writing

At Converge, we have one basic premise: everyone's a bad writer and needs to improve. This extends to all forms of communication, but is usually most evident with writing. Why do we say everyone is a bad writer?

1. It's a skill that's often used, yet rarely practiced
2. The writing skills you were taught at school are rarely the skills you need
3. The output of great written communication hides the effort that went into it

We will work with everyone at Converge, often extensively, on improving their writing (and general) communication skills. This is not a reflection on any one person, but a genuine desire to help everyone be able to most purely express their feelings, thinking and raw intellectual brainpower on a topic, so their teammates can truly appreciate what an amazing person they are at their job.

As a start to good written communication, we recommend a few readings and have a [Google Doc that lists them](https://docs.google.com/a/convergeindustries.com/document/d/1eUWmUU5bByj2NPRtC--q0Xl27GXXnAce-9PQkgBEiVQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Communication

### Slack vs Email vs Conversations

There are three tools we use to communicate with each other at Converge: Slack, Email and Conversations. We try to encourage using the most effective, and respectful, form of communication that's appropriate for what you need to do, when you need to do it. As such, we do not have "Only use Slack for X" or "Only use email for Y." However, here are some guidelines that may help inform which communication channel to use:

1. Face-to-Face conversations are usually best for arriving at agreement and consensus.
2. Slack is useful for having a "stream" of communication that others can opt-into (or out-of) depending on their current work.
3. Email is best for writing long-prose, "let me sit down and really organize my thoughts." (see more below about Email)
4. In general, we find most of our communication goes through Slack (see below for more about Slack).

We have three golden rules about happy communicating at Converge:

1. Take communications at face-value: It's easy to oversubscribe motive or meaning to any form of communication, but by having radical candor, we know that if something needs to be said, it will. As such, we try and treat any message with humility and empathy. If the tone of a message seems sharp, perhaps it's not directed at you, but because the writer was rushed, or having a bad day on their end.
2. Be respectful and honest in your communications: Every time you communicate with a team member, you're placing a demand on their time and focus. Be respectful your communications "asking" for that time and focus. Honor the the time and focus a team member is giving you by being honest and frank, instead of being passive or sugar-coating something, thereby giving them more work in order to divine the true intent of what you said.
3. Make communication high-quality, and high bandwidth: Ideally, each communication should be improving your work, Converge's value, and our team. By communicating eloquently and succinctly, we are able to both improve Converge, and give us more time to work (and hang out with each other)  

Other notes:
* There is no "seriousness" rating to which communication channel is being used.
* Speed of response is usually: (fastest -> slowest) Conversation -> Slack -> Email
* Length of communication is generally: (most time consuming -> least) Email -> Slack -> Conversation

### Google Docs

We typically use Google Docs for work on projects, or recording notes. Occasionally, we will use it to start a communication that we want to invite specific, point-by-point feedback on.

### Friday #Updates

Every Friday, everyone on the team posts an update in the #daily-review channel in Slack that includes:

* What they accomplished (and did not) this week
* What they will accomplish next week
* How they could have improved in the past week

This makes it easy to keep in the loop on projects and also keeps everyone at Converge accountable to everyone else to do their part.

### Proactive checkins

When we're all in the office, it's easy to see when a teammate is around or available. When an individual is out of the office, this visibility immediately drops to 0.  When we're working remotely, it's our responsibility to let our teammates know when we're around and available.

**Doing this is as easy as posting a message in Slack to say when you drop in or leave.**

It's also a good idea to be proactive about letting teammates know what you're working on and how it's going. 18F has a great paragraph on this:

*Proactively communicate. As Kate Garklavs, a content designer who lives in Portland, puts it: “Because I'm remote, I've taken to sending short, proactive progress updates to my teams ("Hey, all — wanted to let you know that I finished writing XYZ and sent it to so-and-so for approval — should hear back by Friday."), even when daily standups aren't required. By sending these short updates throughout the day, I hope to keep folks in the loop with regards to what I've been up to.”*

With increased individual flexibility, since we're all working at the same time less, it's important to go above and beyond in letting people know when we are around.

### Calendar Updates

If you're working remotely or from home, you should put a calendar event indicating where you are working from for all the time you are out of the office.

## Slack

### How to use Slack @ Converge

#### Channels
We heavily use channels at Converge to organize the threads of thought and topics of conversation. This also allows us to, cognitively, easily prioritize and triage communications by simply looking at what's unread in the sidebar. It also allows us to more easily search for material post-hoc.

#### @ mentions
We use @username mentions in channels to specifically get the attention of a teammate in a "I could use a reply as soon as convenient." Think of it as the equivalent of waving your hand at someone across a room.  

#### Direct Messages
We try to only use Direct Messages when working together on a specific task or project. We expect someone will respond to a DM as fast as they can (but not instantly). It's like if you were seated next to your teammate and were collaborating side-by-side.

We try to not use use group DMs, as this can easily form a clique and segregate, rather than unify, a team.

#### GIFs & Emojis

We use GIFs and Emojis to inject some humor into our daily work. However, please avoid oversharing/using either. This is not a Facebook popularity contest. We will occasionally setup Slackbot responses to **infrequently** used words as a small practical joke on each other.

#### Slackbot Integrations

We rarely integrate new Slackbots, as they can usually access a lot of info, and rarely provide real value (assuming we even remember they exist).

#### Threads

Threads are an interesting feature in Slack, and to be honest, we have not developed a great strategy for using them. Generally, we find that they've provided the most benefit as a way to attach a "log" of a conversation to a specific message. For example, we may use threads to discuss an auto-posted news item in #uas-news or a Rollbar exception in #sys-ops. We always try to remember to check the "Notify the channel" option.

#### Slack Statuses

Slack statuses are an easy way to communicate where you are located and when you are away from your desk. If you are working from home, taking PTO, or sick, you should update your Slack status to reflect this. In short, your Slack status is the absolute, ground truth for the rest of the team about where you are.

#### Slack Activity Indicators

There are 4 states in which a teammate can be in on Slack:

1. *Active (green)*. Similar to when someone is sitting at their desk in the office, they are considered available and can be expected to respond in the range of a few minutes to an hour.
2. *Do not disturb (green)*. This teammate is at their computer, but focusing. Expect a response when they are done with whatever they are focusing on, but don't wait for them.
3. *Do not disturb (gray). *This teammate is away from their computer and off work. Expect a response the next work day.
4. *Away*. This teammate is off work or temporarily away. Check the #office or #travel channel — when a user goes away, whether it's during their work day or when the day is ending, they should post a message letting the team know they are stepping out. If they posted a message in #office saying they were stepping away but coming back, expect a response when they get back. If they posted a message saying they were done for the day, you should expect a response the next work day.

Obviously, edge cases exist, but it's important that on both ends of our communication (both asking and responding) we uphold these expectations so that everyone on our team can plan their work effectively.

## Email

Email is a vastly misused, and oddly over-powerful, tool for communication. Internally, we try to use email very sparingly. However, the rest of the world uses email quite a bit, and as such, it is an important part of how we communicate with customers, investors and vendors.

The most important thing to know to be an ace at email is this:

Email is a tool which requires __active__ management and does __not__ automatically make you a good writer.

Think of email as being put in charge of a garden. You're probably not a gardener (or even done gardening before as part of your job). It's going to require care, curation, trimming, pruning and watering. You're going to want to get feedback from people with a real green thumb about they have a seemingly amazing garden, yet put little time into it.

Some basic rules of email at Converge are:

1. Emailing Customers: please run all (initially) emails by Dave for editing and PR/marketing review. Honestly, 99% of us are not good writers, and need editing and proofreading help with our written communications.
2. No Email Left Unread: Saying you never saw (or never read) an email is __not__ acceptable at Converge. If you are receiving too much email, talk with Dave about strategies (he worked at an email startup, and has made a living consulting on email use)
3. Respond Quick and Decisively to Emails: We try and respond to all customer emails within an hour, and almost all other emails within 24hrs. The goal of any email conversation is to End the Conversation- how can you write an email that provides the information needed so someone will not have to write you back for more, or leave them elated to have heard from you and thought "that's done!"?

## Transparency

### Public Slack Channels

Almost all Slack conversation should happen in public Slack channels where the rest of the team can see it. You may not subscribe to or pay attention to every channel, but conversations that happen in public channels are searchable and readable by the whole team, so when someone wants to know how we decided on some course of action, Slack gives them a place to look back at the conversation.

Not every ping or question needs to happen publicly, but when in question, you should err on the side of posting publicly.

### Public Calendars

Work calendars should be shared to make scheduling meetings really easy and also to let the rest of the team see where we’re spending our time. Personal calendars often have sensitive information, and should be kept separate. Work calendars are documentation of how we’re allocating our hours and are useful for the rest of the team.

### Open Metrics

When we measure something, it should be visible to everyone on the team. Our stats will be great sometimes and disappointing others, but when we hide or silo the hard stats, fewer people can help fix them. We’ll try to keep the most critical stats posted in the office, but any data that we’re collecting should be open to everyone.

### We Succeed Together When We Trust Each Other

Communication and negotiation among groups of people is difficult, but the more honest we can be with each other, the easier it will be for us to trust one another and work together as a team. Openness and honesty will be critical to our success, which is why this is one of our core values, and why it’s a mantra we repeat in many conversations.
