# Ownership and Autonomy

As a result of our discussion on our working agreements at Converge during our 10/13/16 Offsite, the team has settled on a "v1" of how we think about project ownership and autonomy. This is a work in progress, and we will be continuing to improve it as we discover there are additional things which we have not thought about.

## Leadership

Often leadership in a company is confusing- there can be the stated leaders with the title, implicit leaders who make the day to day calls, and the shadow power brokers. We try to simplify this by bringing as much transparency and explicitness to leadership as possible. The intent is not to create a rigid power hierarchy, but to provide clarity and invest leadership where it can make the most impact.

**Maxims**
* There should always be a clear leader for any aspect of Converge- be it product, HR, technical, etc.
* Leadership is not oration. It is the responsibility of supporting your teammates, or yourself, to make a project, however small, successful.
* Leadership does not mean dictatorship, aggression or drama.
* Everyone is a leader, and everyone knows who leads what they are part of.

## Decision Making

At Converge, we want to instill everyone with the ability to be a Plenipotentiary and make decisions as fast as possible. If [Getting the Message Garcia]() is one side of the coin, the other is that we regularly entrust individuals to be [Plenipotentiaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenipotentiary) of Converge and give them the resources to act as such.

What does a 19th century term have to do with a 21st century startup? In the past, Plenipotentiaries existed because communication was so slow and unreliable that it could not match the speed of events on the ground. So the very best in a government were given a 007-esque license to do as they saw fit to protect and advance the nation's interests.

In a startup, we are constantly starved for resources. So while we can communicate rapidly, we often do not have the time to redundantly investigate, think about, and act upon information or make decisions. This is why it is important to give individuals the ability to act as Plenipotentiaries on their projects.

Since we are working with high-performance teammates that we implicitly trust, we find that the results are often delightful when we have a teammate tackle a project, and come back with splendid results.

**Maxims**
* Decisions are made by a single individual, but their decision is often the result of careful reasoning that solicits input, cultivates feedback and seeks criticisms from multiple parties.
* Decisions should be made fast and executed on quickly, not stuck in limbo waiting for opinions. Do your best to reach consensus in the shortest time possible and move forward.
* We place value on a decision that has had deliberate thought put into and was made, and do not care for decisions that were delayed by waiting for opinions in order to Cover Your Ass.
* Decisions will be made, that in hindsight, were wrong. As responsible, trusting adults, what we care most about regarding these decisions is what we can learn and improve upon from them.
