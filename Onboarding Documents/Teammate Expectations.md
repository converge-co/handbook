# Teammate Expectations

At Converge, we expect to work with excellent individuals, and have high expectations for each other. By exemplifying and holding each other to a higher standard, we create a workplace where every day we look forward to seeing and getting the opportunity to work with each other. Below is a list of our core expectations and values we will all achieve as individuals, and help each other to keep performing at.

# Be a Responsible, Trusting Adult

As much as possible in the Employee Handbook, we avoid caveats, bandaids, and "teammates who abuse X may be asked to..." This is because we have a basic trust that all of us will behave as responsible adults. A responsible adult sees a policy, and uses common sense to either take the course of action their peers would approve of, or ask for clarification if needed. They do not try to game the system because they take a longer view of their time and relationships at Converge. Responsible adults run a tight ship in their work life and are exemplars of the great teammate who everyone cannot stop raving about many years afterwards.

By contrast, an adult who we cannot trust, and who is not responsible, seeks to take advantage of perceived loopholes, lack of explicit details in policies, and the social contract we've all agreed to at Converge. At many companies, these individuals somehow manage to get HR policies informally named after them, and never in a good way. As much as possible, we try to filter out these individuals before they join Converge, but if we do find ourselves working with such an individual, our responsibility is to recognize this behavior and remove it from the team.

As everyone comes in with different expectations of what is normal and accepted (particularly after being a part of a different culture at a previous company), we fully expect that there may be an adjustment period, and conversations, during the first few weeks where a new hire is still learning about Converge.

# Radical Candor

At Converge, we have an enormous amount of respect and empathy for each other. Which is why we value giving direct, honest feedback and critiques. To do anything less means that we're not committing ourselves to helping each other improve and become better. That's why we believe in [Radical Candor](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/
)

**Please stop to take a moment, and thoroughly read that post.**

If you are not coming from a corporate culture that has used Radical Candor before, it can be startling to be immersed in one that is going to be forthright and direct with you in their feedback.

We find there are a few things that help ease the transition into being radically candid:
1. As a team, we will try to call out that we are being radically candid with you at first. E.g., "Dave, to be radically candid, I thought this work was not good because you are too distracted at the moment by many tasks."
2. We will encourage you to give radically candid feedback from the start- "Please tell me, with radical candor, what you think here."
3. Our knee-jerk reaction to feedback can often be defensive and fearful. Reframe the feedback in your mind by asking "[Paul] really cares about me as an individual, how is he trying to help me here?"

# Taking Action and Making Decisions

## Get the Message to Garcia

Often times, we find it is easier to ask questions than get down to work. In a small company, where time is our most precious resource, it can become fatal to take time from others by asking needless questions or awaiting an explicit directive to take the next step. Instead, we all expect that each of us is working to [get the message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf)

After reading Hubbard's essay, you might have the following questions:
1. **So I shouldn't ask any questions?** No! Ask away! Hubbard does not explicitly state it, but getting the message to Garcia only works if you are given adequate information and expectations before you start. If we fail at doing that, keep asking- it's not called "Get the Thing to Some Guy"
2. **Really? I can just go ahead as fast as I can?** Yes, we trust you! Since Hubbard is mostly writing from the employer's side, he does not call out that the employee entrusted to Get the Message to Garcia enjoys the trust of their teammates to make decisions and take action as they see fit.
3. **Did this Rowan guy actually exist?** (Yep)[]

# Respect comes from actions, not compliments

Respect does not just mean saying nice things about each other when asked, but maintaining a selfless conscious about how our actions impact each other. We demonstrate our respect for each other by proactively creating work products which another teammate is excited to interact with, by not abusing a teammate's time or attention, and by supporting each other through proactive help, well-chosen words of recognition and critical feedback.
