# Converge Core Values

## Be better today than yesterday.

Being better is more important than being the "best", because "best" means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.

## Treat others the way they'd like to be treated.

Our customers and teammates have different needs from our own, so we must consider their  perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best product when we understand the people we are building for.

## Great People, Great Products, Great Company

Our team is the key factor that makes Converge a great company. With a great team, you can make a great product. With a great product, you can make a great company.

## We succeed together when we trust each other.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction on teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.

## Sales are driven by product, not by marketing

We believe that a great product is more important to driving sales than slick marketing of vaporware.

## Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry. Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.
