# Policy Changes

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we improve and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose, and make changes, to our policies.

## How Changes Are Made

Anyone is free to propose changes by creating a new ticket on Github. The ticket should initially be focused on answering three questions:
1. What is the rationale or motivation behind this change?
2. What is the idea(s) for the change?
3. What is the expected outcome after making the change?

There does not need to be a single idea, it is okay to propose many, rough ideas for a change.

Dave will take time, once a week, to look to at these new issues with the goal of deciding which issues should be addressed directly, outside of the Handbook, and which should be iterated upon.

As needed, Dave will gather more feedback, schedule time to talk about the changes as a team, and assign team members to do further research and create proposals for changes. Anyone is welcome to contribute to proposals and tickets, but there must be an owner responsible for pushing the change forward.

As quickly as possible, we will be driving a proposed change towards one of these results:
1. The change is accepted and ready to be merged into the Handbook
2. The change is shelved, likely due to us deciding the change is not appropriate for the team at this time, but there is a clear trigger for when the change will be reconsidered.
3. The change is declined. If circumstances or new information arise that would substantively alter the reasoning and discussion around the change, a team member can re-propose the change.

A change may be accepted, shelved or declined, in a variety of ways. First and foremost, we will strive to achieve consensus with the entire team on a change being accepted. For many reasons (e.g., legal, outside factors, experience, wise counsel, vision for the company, equality for the team, etc), the cofounders or board may decline, shelve or make a change to the Handbook, with, or without, feedback or discussion from the rest of the team.

## Proposals

Any substantive change to the handbook should be laid out in a proposal that the team can discuss and comment upon. Proposals should lay out the details of the change and the reasons for making them.

## Discussion Meetings

Every proposal should have an open meeting for feedback from the team. Dave will schedule these, and will be there for all of these discussions. Everyone is invited to all of these discussions, though attendance is not required. Participation in these conversations is important because it will provide context and different view points for how different team members relate to or will be impacted by a certain policy.

Team members can also talk to their manager about concerns they have with a given change or policy privately, as well as ask that the manager bring up the issue if they’re not comfortable doing it themselves.

Team members can comment on the proposal document before or after the meeting, in the meeting directly, or they can privately ask their manager or another employee to bring up their comments anonymously. However, other employees have no obligation to represent the views of a peer, and any peer pressure will not be tolerated.

Notes from the meetings should be recorded at the bottom of the proposal document.

## Merging

After changes have been accepted, and Dave decides they are ready to be merged into the handbook, he will do the merge on Github, update the card in the Github project and post about it in Slack.

For major changes, he or another team member may also write a post about the change, and the factors that went into making it. Posts should (with their permission) acknowledge all of the community members that participated in the discussion and helped us make the change.

## Platforms and Tools

We’re using several different tools and platforms to collect feedback and discuss the handbook.

### Github

The handbook is hosted on Github, and anyone with a Github account can make an issue or open a pull request. This is an important home for the project, and we want to encourage and reward participation.

However, work on the Handbook does not need to happen on exclusively on Github. When we make changes, they should be merged on Github, and we should explain our rationale there, but we don’t need to rehash the whole conversation.

### Google Docs

Any proposalsProposals should be written in Google Docs and linked to on the Github issue. There is a folder for ‘Handbook Research and Proposals’ which will hold the documents for research being done and proposals being written. This folder will be accessible to everyone internally, but will not be public.

### Slack #handbook

This channel is a good place for us to comment on policy changes asynchronously. Any questions, concerns, ideas, or discussion about our handbook can go here. If a conversation seems particularly interesting, we'll document it in Google docs or in a Github issue for future reference.

## Adoption

Everyone at Converge needs to sign an [Acknowledgement of Receipt for the Employee Handbook](https://github.com/converge-co/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt.md), but any change to these documents need to be acknowledged by every employee. We will usually have an employee do this on, or before, their first day at work.

Because we want these policies to constantly improve, we will merge changes as they are ready. To make enforcing policy clear and unambiguous, we will adopt the changes at the beginning of each week (although we expect changes to be rare). We will use tags on Github to mark these canonical versions of the handbook, and we'll host them all at [convergeindustries.com/handbook](https://convergeindustries.com/handbook). They will be labeled with the dates that they applied, so if there is ever a question or complaint about a policy violation, it will be clear which policies applied on which dates at Converge.

Every employee will need to sign an [Acknowledgement of Receipt of Changes to the Employee Handbook](https://github.com/converge-co/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt%20of%20Changes.md) when new changes are introduced to the Handbook. If an employee refuses to sign the Acknowledgement, or does not do so within one week (unless given an extension by a manager for mitigating circumstances), they may be asked to leave Converge.
