# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Converge, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](https://github.com/converge-co/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), Converge encourages employees to take as much vacation as they need to be healthy, happy and productive.

## Vacation

**How Often?**

* We encourage team members to take a minimum of 3 weeks (15 work days) of vacation time throughout the year, in addition to the holidays (bank, religious or otherwise) they choose to observe (so approximately four weeks in total).
* To make it easier to get into the habit of taking vacation in the high pressure environment that is a startup, we encourage new hires to think of this as a mandatory one week per quarter. However, this is a recommendation and anyone can take vacation however they see fit.
* There is no maximum vacation recommendation, though there may be more and longer conversations for unique situations in which a teammate might want to take, say, more than 2-3 weeks off.
* It's great to take time off after youâ€™ve been at Converge for about 3 months.
* This time is separate from holidays teammates choose to celebrate, and outside of sick/personal days, bereavement/compassionate leave, and family leave.

**Logistics**

When scheduling vacation, add it to your calendar for the entire time you're gone as an all day event with "Initials: OOO"

As the length of vacation increases, we increase the amount of time we give notice, as well as who we "clear" our vacation with.

1 day: Let the team know a week in advance.
2-5 days: Let your manager know at least two weeks in advance.
1-2 weeks: Have a conversation with your manager at least one -> two months in advance about the exact dates. While unlikely, it may be that we will ask you to start your vacation earlier or later, for example due to your key role in a project that is starting.
>2 weeks: Have a conversation with one of the founders at least three months in advance.

## Health Leave

We do not have a fixed number of sick days, instead employees are encouraged to take leave as needed to improve their health, including recovering from illnesses, injuries and medical appointments. However, this is a benefit for each individual and may be revoked, or altered, in individual cases.

* We have a strict "if you're feeling sick, stay home" policy. Nobody likes it when someone else shows up sick to the office with the cold, and, in turn, makes everyone else sick.
* Startups can be stressful, and stress can lead to poor sleep. If you had a poor night's sleep, and feel that an extra hour or two of rest will make you more productive that day, please take the time and come in later. However, we do expect you will adjust your day to still put in a full day's work.
* If you have a dependent or significant other who is sick with the cold, flu, etc, we ask that they please avoid coming inside the office (even for a minute) until they feel better.
* Recognizing that it is difficult to schedule doctor's appointments for non-working hours, we ask that, if possible, you schedule them at the very beginning or end of your day.

For unexpected illnesses, or taking more rest, please post as soon as possible in Slack #general that you will be out that day (or send a txt message to a teammate). Otherwise we get concerned something really bad happened to you!

If team mates are scheduling inpatient or outpatient procedures, evaluations or surgeries, they should let their manager know as soon as possible about the time they will be out of office.

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support. These discussions will be kept confidential.

## Recurring Disruptions to Productivity

If we find an employee is experiencing, or causing others to experience, recurring disruptions to their productivity due to health leave, or a physical or mental condition while working, their manager may take action as appropriate. This action could include, but is not limited to, mandating the employee take a leave of absence (paid or unpaid), having the employee work remotely, or allocating the employee a fixed number of sick days for a set period of time.

Our litmus test for "Recurring Disruptions to Productivity" includes, among others, repeatable instances of:

* Difficulty of scheduling meetings, or meetings often being rescheduled
* Personally missing deadlines and goals
* Collaborators having to change their goals, actions or deadlines to accommodate for the affected employee
* Lack of understanding of tasks, or projects

## Health, Wellness, Exercise

Our goal is to support you living a healthy lifestyle.

Health and wellness classes and activities are important, but can become disruptive to the rest of the team if a teammate is unexpectedly leaving during regular hours. Currently, we ask that you treat being absent for exercise or a class/activity the same as taking a day off- add it to your calendar at least a week in advance and let your teammates know the day of.

For regular activities (e.g., working out for an hour over lunch every day), we expect you will adjust your working hours to still be productive. Also, please block out this time in your calendar so that your teammates know you will not be available.
