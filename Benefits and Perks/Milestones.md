# Milestones for Benefits and Perks

As Converge succeeds, we will be able to incorporate additional perks and benefits which were not possible at earlier stages of the company. For some perks and benefits not currently offered, but which we know we want to offer in the future, we will assign a milestone for a quantitative metric that we can look forward to.

**Important!** We will keep the exact metrics of the milestone private and only accessible to teammates, as they include confidential numbers on revenue, customers, etc. Never share this information with outsiders, either in casual discussion or during interviewing candidates.
