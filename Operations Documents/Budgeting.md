# Budgeting

Budgeting (all spending except salaries, which, for the first 10 employees will not be included in these budgets) is done by the founders immediately after the company  are set so that the budgets can reflect the company's goals for the quarter. The budgets will be quarterly and will initially be broken down into:

* Design Resources
* Technical Infrastructure
* Business Development, Marketing & PR
* Community Outreach
* Rent & Office Infrastructure
* Administration
* Security
* Legal

One person will be responsible for each area of spending, and all related expenses should be approved by that person.

The total budgets will be internally public so all employees can see where the company resources are going.
