# Sharing Files at Converge

## Base Directories

At the base of every member of the Converge teamâ€™s directory, there should be 6 directories:

1. **Dropbox (Converge)/** You should treat this as your main "Documents" folder and keep any save-able work in this.
  * Converge Team Folder - We use this folder to share general documents, etc, on a temporary basis
	* Ext Materials - These are 3rd party (e.g., FAA) materials we keep as a general library of knowledge
	* Design - A folder with all app-related materials for UI/UX.
	* Graphic Design - A folder w/ all of our graphic assets (logo, headshots, etc)
	* Projects - This is a folder you should create in your work Dropbox folder, and keep any shared project folders in here


2. **repositories/** All Converge repositories should be checked out to this folder.

3. **other-repositories/** All 3rd party repositories should reside here

## Tools for Collaboration

### Versioning

If we have to version documents (such as with Keynote), we use the designer major/minor version number approach. A document ends in `-MAJOR_NUMBER MINOR LETTER` (e.g., `-2B`).

* Major versions represent large, conceptual jumps
* Minor versions represent variations or incremental improvements

If we need to add comments or tweaks to a specific version at the same time as others, we'll also append our initials to the name of a doc.

### Google Docs

We use Google Docs for writing articles, blog posts, or meeting notes.

### Google Sheets

Google Sheets is used in place of MS Excel

### Keynote

We use Keynote for presentations.

### Sketch

We use Sketch for all of our UI/UX design work

### Omnigraffle

We use Omnigraffle for workflows and diagrams
