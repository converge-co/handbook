# Effective meetings and group work

To increase flexibility in how employees work at Converge, we agree on a shared set of constraints for group work and meetings.

## Mindset for Meetings at Converge

### Meetings start on time

If you're leading a meeting, it's your responsibility to start the meeting on time. If you're attending a meeting, you are responsible for showing up on time. If you will be more than a minute late to the meeting, you must notify the meeting organizer.

### Shorter Meetings are always better

Meetings should not extend beyond:

* 30 mins for one-off meetings
* 15 mins for meetings occurring weekly or daily
* 1 hour for monthly or quarterly meetings

### Inviting team members to a meeting is a rude demand

Whenever a team member is asked to attend a meeting, it represents an ask for that time member to sacrifice their time and individual productivity. As such, we should view inviting others to meetings as one of the highest demands we can have for them, and only invite them when their presence will substantially improve the quality of the meeting

Team member should always feel open to attend team meetings, but should extend the organizer beforehand the courtesy of asking if they would be welcome. Organizers should default to allowing additional attendees, but also not feel obligated to honor every request. Likewise, we should all recognize that there may be a variety of reasons not related to us, individually, for why an organizer may wish for more people to attend a meeting, such as a 1-on-1 customer meeting.

### Meeting invites are not a signal of power or status

In many company cultures, meeting invites often devolve into a status of power and importance. We must always be proactive and vigilant to not let this become a habit at Converge. Some warning signs of this habit forming include:

* Individuals feeling slighted that they were not invited to a meeting which did not materially involve them or their work
* Managers just "dropping by" meetings and not contributing
* Gossip within the office pertaining to who is attending what meeting, and why

## Meeting Guidelines

### Meeting Scheduling and Invites

Meetings are scheduled, and RSVPs managed, via Google Calendar.

### Meetings happen during regular hours

All team members should make themselves available for face-to-face meetings between 10:00am-4:00p Pacific Time, as long as they are scheduled at least 24 hours in advance. If possible, a meeting should be scheduled on Mon/Wed/Fri of a week. If a meeting needs to happen outside of these hours, the meeting organizer should scheduled it a week in advance.

### Meetings should have a video option

If you're hosting a meeting with a remote worker invited, it's your responsibility to provide a video link before the meeting starts for them to join.

If you're attending a meeting remotely, you should join the video call *before* a meeting starts. It's your responsibility to ensure this is possible â€” this means being in a quiet place with a fast internet connection before the meeting starts. Calling into a meeting via phone or from a public place is unacceptable.

For some meetings, voice calls will be sufficient - this decision is up to the meeting organizer when they create the meeting.

## Prerequisites for successful meetings

The following things are pre-requisites for successful group work:

* A fast, reliable internet connection. Remote employees should make all efforts to mitigate video call lag.
* A quiet place to take meetings

If you're planning to work with another person on the team, you should make sure these are available.
