# Employee Privacy

## Workspace Privacy

As an employer, it is Converge’s goal to monitor or track our employees in as few ways as possible. We want Converge employees to feel a sense of ownership towards their personal workspaces and be comfortable at the office. However, in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Converge employees, company property (e.g. desks, laptops, and other devices) is subject to search. For instance, this might be used if management learns that an employee has brought a gun to work or has stolen company property.

This means that while the company will always try to respect employee privacy, employees do not have a right to privacy in their workspaces in any property that belongs to Converge. Converge reserves the right to search company property at any time, without warning, to ensure compliance with our policies, including those that cover employee safety, workplace violence, harassment, theft, and possession of prohibited items. If you use a lock on any item of company property, you must give a copy of the key or combination to one of the founders.

## Email and Internet Privacy

Converge email and Internet are not being actively monitored by anyone at Converge, but because they are company resources that are managed according to company policy, you should not expect privacy from either. The company has both the ability and the right to look at employee usage for both in order to protect employee safety and wellbeing, as well as company property and interests.

## Communications are Not Private

Email and other messages, e.g., communication sent via Slack, Dialpad or other software apps and services, (collectively known as "Messages"), including attachments, sent and received from a Converge email address or account are the property of Converge. We reserve the right to access, monitor, read, and/or copy these Messages at any time, for any reason. You should not expect privacy for any Message you send using your Converge email or account, including Messages that you consider to be personal or label with a designation such as “Personal” or “Private.”

## Use of Messages for Personal Communications

The email system and Messages are intended for official Company business. If you send personal Messages through the Company’s email system or accounts, you must exercise discretion as to the number and type of Messages you send. You must also ensure that your personal use of the email system and Messages does not interfere in any way with your job duties or performance.

## All Conduct Rules Apply to Messages

All of our policies and rules of conduct apply to employee use of the email system and other accounts, software and services. This means, for example, that you may not use the email system to send harassing or discriminatory Messages, including messages with explicit sexual content or pornographic images; to send threatening messages; or to reveal company trade secrets.

## Professional Tone and Content

We expect you to exercise discretion in using electronic communications equipment. When you send email using a Converge email address or Converge social account, you are representing Converge. Make sure that your messages are professional and appropriate, in tone and content. Remember, although email or social media may seem like a private conversation, they can be printed, saved, and forwarded to unintended recipients. You should not send any email/message/update/etc. that you wouldn’t want our team, your family, or our competitors to read.

## Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, employees should not open Message attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the Message appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to Converge’s system, you must inform the founders immediately.

Employees may not share their email passwords with anyone, including coworkers or family members. Revealing passwords to the Company’s email system could allow an outsider to attack the Converge network

## Internet Use Is Not Private

We reserve the right to monitor employee use of the Internet at any time. You should not expect that your use of the Internet—including but not limited to the sites you visit, the amount of time you spend online, and the communications you have—will be private.
