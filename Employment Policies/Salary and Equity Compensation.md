#Salary and Equity Compensation

The following policy will apply to compensation offers for the first 10 employees at Converge. After we have hired 10 people, we will likely revise the salary rubric and equity amount.

##Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Converge a desirable place to work and helping our employees lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working at Converge (because of the people, product, and opportunity for growth) and then fades into the background.

Traditional salary negotiations are also heavily biased because they rely on individual gut feelings and negotiation. This favors candidates who come from more privileged backgrounds and are afforded more confidence during the hiring process.

At the beginning of each year (in January), we will adjust this rubric to make sure it stays at market rate.

##Equity

All new employees should  check out our [Guide to Your Equity](https://github.com/converge-co/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Guide%20to%20Your%20Equity.md), which walks through the nuances of owning Converge stock options.
